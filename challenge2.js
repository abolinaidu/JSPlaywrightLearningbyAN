//After a test suite runs, you receive an array of test results (strings: "pass", "fail", "skip"). Write a JavaScript program using a for loop that counts how many tests passed, failed, and were skipped. Print a test report with total tests, counts, pass rate percentage, and a verdict (all passed → ready for release, ≤2 failures → review, >2 failures → block release).

let testResults = ["pass", "fail", "skip"];
let passCount = 0;
let failCount = 0;
let skipCount = 0;

for (let  i=0;i<testResults.length;i++)
{
    if (testResults[i] === "pass") {
        passCount++;
    }   else if (testResults[i] === "fail") {   
        failCount++;
    }   else if (testResults[i] === "skip") {
        skipCount++;
    }   
}
let totalTests = testResults.length;
let passRate = (passCount / totalTests * 100);
console.log("Test Report:");
console.log("Total Tests: " + totalTests);
console.log("Passed: " + passCount);
console.log("Failed: " + failCount);
console.log("Skipped: " + skipCount);
console.log("Pass Rate: " + passRate + "%");

if (failCount === 0) {
    console.log("Verdict: Ready for release");
} else if (failCount <= 2) {
    console.log("Verdict: Review required");
} else {
    console.log("Verdict: Block release");
